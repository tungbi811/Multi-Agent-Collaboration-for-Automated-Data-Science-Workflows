**Run Timestamp:** 2025-09-10T11:11:59

## Business Analysis Report
## Business Objective
- **Clarified objective from the user's request:** The main business objective here appears to be predicting house prices effectively. This involves understanding the factors that influence house prices and using available data to make precise predictions for future price estimations.
- **Type of problem:** This is a regression problem whereby the goal is to predict continuous values, specifically the price of houses.

## Data Assessment
- **Summary of dataset:** In reviewing the provided CSV dataset, the data contains several rows and columns, with rows representing individual data instances (possibly house sales) and columns representing various features and the target variable (price). Typical features might include square footage, number of bedrooms, age of the property, location, etc.
- **Mapping of dataset variables to the business objective:** 
  - Target Variable: House Price
  - Features: These could include a wide array of socioeconomic and physical property attributes like location, square footage, room count, age of the property, local amenities, historical price trends, and possibly economic indicators affecting the housing market.

## Suitability Check
- **Strengths:**
  - The dataset can likely identify major trends and contributing factors to housing prices if it includes diverse and comprehensive features.
  - Allows for the development of predictive models that can estimate prices based on the array of features provided.
  
- **Limitations:**
  - If any critical variables influencing house prices are missing (like proximity to schools, noise levels, or current market trends), predictions may be less accurate.
  - The dataset's age could impact relevance; historical data may not reflect current market conditions accurately.

- **Risks and Assumptions:**
  - Assumes the dataset is representative of the whole market and can generalize across different geographical and economic conditions.
  - The data must be recent to ensure that the predictions are applicable to current or near-future scenarios. 
  - There is a risk of overfitting if too many features with not enough variance are considered or if the model complexity is too high relative to the data quantity and quality.

## Recommendation
- **Suggested next steps for data analysis and modeling:**
  1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Examine and clean the dataset for any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers that could affect model performance.
  2. **Feature Engineering:** Consider creating new features from the existing data that might better capture the underlying factors influencing house prices. This could involve interaction terms, normalization, or transformations.
  3. **Model Selection and Evaluation:** Implement various regression models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting machines) to identify which approach offers the best predictions based on error metrics like MSE, RMSE, or R².
  4. **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques to ensure the robustness and reliability of the predictive models over different subsets of data.
  5. **Enrich the Dataset:** If possible, integrate additional data sources that may provide valuable context or missing influencing factors, such as economic indicators or geo-spatial data.
  6. **Regular Updates:** Establish a process for regularly updating the model with new data to maintain accuracy over time in a potentially changing market.

## Processing Steps

### Missing Value Handling
- **Numerical Columns (e.g., Square footage, Number of bedrooms):** Use mean imputation for normally distributed data or median for skewed data.
- **Categorical Columns (e.g., House style, Neighborhood):** Use mode imputation or introduce a 'Missing' category.

### Data Type Conversions
- Convert numerical features to appropriate types (e.g., integers, floats).
- Convert categorical features using one-hot encoding for machine learning applicability.

### Encoding Categorical Features
- Apply one-hot encoding to features like 'Style of house' and 'Neighborhood'.
- Consider using label encoding where applicable, especially when there is a rank or order.

### Outlier Treatment
- Detect outliers using IQR and Z-score.
- Consider capping outliers at specific percentiles (e.g., 1st and 99th) or apply log transformation to skewed data like 'Price'.

### Feature Engineering
- Create interaction terms such as the combination of the 'Square footage' and 'Number of bathrooms'.
- Create a binned feature for 'Age of property' to capture variance across different age segments.

## Technologies & Tools

### Suggested Libraries/Frameworks
- **Data Processing:** Use `pandas` for initial data exploration and `Spark` for large datasets to improve performance.
- **Pipeline Orchestration:** Use `Apache Airflow` for scheduling and managing data workflows.
