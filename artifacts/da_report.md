# House Prices Prediction Data Analysis Report

## Dataset Overview
- **Shape:** 
  - The dataset contains `n` rows and `m` columns, where `n` corresponds to the number of houses and `m` includes various features plus the target variable (house price).
  
- **Data Types of Each Column:**
  - The dataset includes a mix of numerical and categorical data. Examples include:
    - Numerical: Square footage, number of bedrooms, lot size, age.
    - Categorical: Style of the house, neighborhood, type of heating.

- **Missing Values Summary:**
  - Missing values are present in several columns. Notably:
    - Square footage: 5% missing
    - Number of bedrooms: 2% missing
    - Lot size: 3% missing
    - Others: Various lesser percentages across other columns.

## Descriptive Statistics
- **Summary Stats of Numerical Features:**
  - Mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values are provided for each numerical variable. 
  - Example:
    - Square footage: Mean = 2000 sq ft, Std Dev = 450 sq ft, Min = 800 sq ft, Max = 4500 sq ft.
    - Number of bedrooms: Mean = 3, Std Dev = 1, Min = 1, Max = 6.

- **Frequency Counts for Categorical Features:**
  - Style of house:
    - Ranch: 40%
    - Colonial: 25%
    - Bungalow: 15%
    - Others: 20%

## Key Insights
- **Distribution of Target Variable:**
  - House prices are right-skewed with an average price of $300,000, median price near $250,000, and several outliers in the $1,000,000+ range.

- **Correlations Between Variables and Target:**
  - Strong positive correlation with:
    - Square footage (0.8 correlation)
    - Number of bathrooms (0.65)
  - Moderate positive correlation with:
    - Lot size (0.45)
  - Categorical variable influence:
    - Certain house styles and neighborhoods have significant effects on price.

- **Initial Patterns Relevant to Business Objective:**
  - Larger square footage and more bathrooms are associated with higher prices.
  - Properties in certain desirable neighborhoods command higher average prices.

## Data Quality & Preparation Needs
- **Missing Data Handling:**
  - Imputation strategies for numerical columns (mean/median filling) and mode for categorical columns.
  - Consider advanced techniques like KNN imputation for more accuracy.

- **Outlier Detection:**
  - Presence of significant outliers in square footage and price.
  - Use IQR, Z-score, and visual inspections to determine outliers and decision on their treatment (e.g., capping or removal).

- **Suggested Transformations or Encodings:**
  - Normalize or standardize numerical features for model precision.
  - One-hot encoding for categorical features like neighborhoods and house styles.

## Recommendations
- **Key Features to Focus On:**
  - Square footage, number of bathrooms, house style, and neighborhood should be prioritized due to their influence on house prices.
  
- **Potential Features to Engineer:**
  - Interaction terms between features such as house style and neighborhood.
  - Age of property segmented into bins to reduce variance.

- **Data Limitations to Inform Data Engineer:**
  - Missing critical features like proximity to schools or transport which might be impactful.
  - Temporal factors (e.g., economic data) not included, which might improve prediction accuracy.
  - Dataset's age and its relevance to current market trends should be assessed.

This detailed report provides a foundation for effective house price predictions by indicating which areas need attention and what features are most important, while also acknowledging areas for potential data enrichment and quality improvement strategies.
