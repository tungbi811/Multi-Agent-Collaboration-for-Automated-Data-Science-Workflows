### Data Flow Stages
1. **Ingestion →** Retrieve raw house price data from source.
2. **Validation →** Ensure incoming data meets schema requirements, check for corrupted rows.
3. **Cleaning →** Address missing values, perform outlier detection and treatment.
4. **Transformation →** Data type conversions, categorical encoding, and feature engineering.
5. **Storage →** Transformed data stored for modeling purposes.

## Processing Steps

### Missing Value Handling
- **Numerical Columns (e.g., Square footage, Number of bedrooms):** Use mean imputation for normally distributed data or median for skewed data.
- **Categorical Columns (e.g., House style, Neighborhood):** Use mode imputation or introduce a 'Missing' category.

### Data Type Conversions
- Convert numerical features to appropriate types (e.g., integers, floats).
- Convert categorical features using one-hot encoding for machine learning applicability.

### Encoding Categorical Features
- Apply one-hot encoding to features like 'Style of house' and 'Neighborhood'.
- Consider using label encoding where applicable, especially when there is a rank or order.

### Outlier Treatment
- Detect outliers using IQR and Z-score.
- Consider capping outliers at specific percentiles (e.g., 1st and 99th) or apply log transformation to skewed data like 'Price'.

### Feature Engineering
- Create interaction terms such as the combination of the 'Square footage' and 'Number of bathrooms'.
- Create a binned feature for 'Age of property' to capture variance across different age segments.

## Technologies & Tools

### Suggested Libraries/Frameworks
- **Data Processing:** Use `pandas` for initial data exploration and `Spark` for large datasets to improve performance.
- **Pipeline Orchestration:** Use `Apache Airflow` for scheduling and managing data workflows.
- **Data Transformation:** Use `dbt` for data transformations and maintaining data models.
- **Imputation & Encoding:** Use `scikit-learn` for encoding strategies and advanced imputation techniques like KNN.

### Storage Formats
- **Parquet:** For storage due to its efficient columnar storage and compression capabilities.
- **SQL Database or Cloud Storage:** Use `Amazon RDS` or `Google BigQuery` for relational storage solutions or `Amazon S3`/`Google Cloud Storage` for object storage.

## Error Handling & Robustness

### Handling Schema Changes and Corrupted Rows
- Use `Great Expectations` for schema validation and data expectations to proactively detect issues.
- Implement alert protocols using `Slack` or email notifications for manual intervention on detected anomalies.

### Logging and Monitoring Recommendations
- Use `ELK Stack` (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for comprehensive logging and monitoring.
- Integrate with `Prometheus` and `Grafana` for real-time monitoring and alerting.

## Handoff

- **Location and Format of the Processed Dataset:**
  - The processed dataset will be stored in a `Parquet` format in a cloud storage bucket within `Amazon S3` or `Google Cloud Storage`.
  - The dataset is prepared and organized into distinct directories for training, validation, and testing partitions ready for use by data scientists.

This structured data pipeline ensures robust handling of house price prediction data processing while allowing flexibility for future datasets. It addresses quality issues, leverages modern data engineering technologies, and presents a high degree of fault tolerance and scalability.
