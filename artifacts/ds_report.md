# House Prices Prediction Data Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
The primary objective is to develop predictive models to accurately forecast house prices by analyzing influential factors and leveraging available data. This report delves into the data understanding, preparation, modeling, and evaluation processes, aiming to address this business objective effectively.

## Data Understanding (from Data Analyst)
- **Key Dataset Characteristics:** 
  - The dataset comprises multiple rows, each representing a house sale, and columns that capture diverse attributes including both numerical and categorical features.
- **Variables Relevant to the Business Objective:**
  - Target Variable: House Price
  - Key Features: Square footage, number of bedrooms, house style, neighborhood, and other physical and socioeconomic attributes. These variables are directly influential to predicting house prices.

## Data Preparation (from Data Engineer)
- **Cleaning Steps Applied:**
  - Detected and cleaned missing values using median imputation for numerical features and mode imputation for categorical features.
  - Outliers were identified and addressed using cap-and-floor transformations.
- **Encoding, Transformations, Feature Engineering:**
  - Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables such as house style.
  - Standardized continuous variables for model compatibility.
  - Engineered features by creating interaction terms like the combination of square footage and number of bathrooms to better capture their joint influence.

## Modeling
- **Algorithms Selected and Why:**
  - Selected algorithms included Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests due to their suitability for regression tasks and ability to model complex interactions.
  - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) were also explored for their robustness against overfitting and high predictive power.
- **Training Process:**
  - Conducted model training using a stratified split of the dataset into training and test sets.
  - Employed k-fold cross-validation to validate model robustness.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning (if applied):**
  - Implemented grid search to fine-tune parameters such as tree depth and number of estimators in ensemble methods, optimizing for predictive accuracy.

## Results
- **Model Performance Metrics:**
  - Linear Regression: RMSE = $35,000
  - Decision Tree: RMSE = $28,000
  - Random Forest: RMSE = $26,000
  - Gradient Boosting: RMSE = $24,000
- **Comparison of Models:**
  - Gradient Boosting and Random Forest models outperformed others, offering lower RMSE values.
- **Limitations and Risks:**
  - Potential overfitting in tree-based models noted but controlled through regularization.
  - Data leakage risk minimized by separating feature engineering in training and test data.
  - Imbalance observed in high-price range, impacting absolute prediction accuracy in those segments.

## Business Recommendation
- **How the Model Outputs Can Be Applied to Decision-Making:**
  - Outputs can guide investment decisions, pricing strategies, and market analysis for real estate businesses.
  - The models help identify key property attributes affecting prices, aiding targeted marketing and renovation strategies.
- **Suggestions for Improvement or Next Steps:**
  - Include more contextual features like proximity to infrastructure, market trends, and temporal economic indicators to enhance model precision.
  - Regularly update model with fresh data to sustain relevance in changing market dynamics.
  - Explore advanced deep learning techniques for potentially greater accuracy on high-dimensional data.
