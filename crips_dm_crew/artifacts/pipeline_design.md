# House Prices Prediction Data Pipeline Design Report

## Pipeline Overview

- **High-level architecture diagram (text-based)**:
  ```
  [Raw Data] --> [Ingestion] --> [Validation] --> [Cleaning] --> [Transformation] --> [Storage]
  ```

- **Data flow stages from raw → processed**:
  1. **Ingestion**: Pulls the raw dataset from the source (e.g., CSV file from cloud storage).
  2. **Validation**: Ensures data conforms to schema expectations (e.g., column names, data types).
  3. **Cleaning**: Addresses missing values and removes/corrects data inconsistencies.
  4. **Transformation**: Applies feature engineering, outlier treatment, and necessary data type conversions.
  5. **Storage**: Saves the processed dataset in a suitable format (e.g., Parquet) for downstream analysis by data scientists.

## Processing Steps

- **Missing value handling**:
  - Apply mean imputation for numerical columns where appropriate.
  - Use mode imputation or ‘Unknown’ for categorical features.
  - For features like 'Alley', use a domain-specific imputation strategy (e.g., mark missing as 'NoAlley').

- **Data type conversions**:
  - Convert numerical representations to appropriate scales (e.g., integers, floats).
  - Ensure categorical data is explicitly treated as categories in the processing pipeline.

- **Encoding categorical features**:
  - Implement one-hot encoding for nominal categories like 'Neighborhood'.
  - Utilize ordinal encoding for inherently ranked features such as 'OverallQual'.

- **Outlier treatment**:
  - Identify and cap outliers beyond the 3-sigma range for key predictors like 'GrLivArea'.
  - Consider techniques such as winsorizing or transformation to mitigate outlier impact.

- **Feature engineering (if required)**:
  - Introduce interaction features like 'YearsSinceRemodel'.
  - Consolidate sparse data for categorical features, reducing the noise potentially hindering model performance.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Suggested libraries/frameworks**:
  - **Pandas** for data manipulation and initial preprocessing.
  - **PySpark** for scalability in larger datasets and quicker processing.
  - **Apache Airflow** for orchestrating the entire data pipeline.
  - **DBT (Data Build Tool)** for transformations and version control in SQL-based environments.

- **Storage formats**:
  - **Parquet**: A columnar storage file format suitable for large datasets, facilitates compression.
  - **AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage**: To store and retrieve CSV/Parquet files, enabling easy access and distribution.
  - **SQL Databases**: Use PostgreSQL or BigQuery for querying processed data.

## Error Handling & Robustness

- **How to handle schema changes, corrupted rows, or missing files**:
  - Incorporate schema versioning and automated tests to detect anomalies.
  - Enable alerts for any failures in data ingestion or processing steps.
  - Employ techniques like schema drift detection to handle unexpected data shape changes.

- **Logging and monitoring recommendations**:
  - Utilize centralized logging frameworks, like ELK Stack or CloudWatch, to track process states.
  - Implement performance monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana to visualize pipeline health.

## Handoff

- **Location and format of the processed dataset ready for Data Scientist**:
  - The processed dataset will be stored as Parquet files in a designated cloud storage bucket accessible to the data science team.
  - Documentation (in markdown or wiki format) detailing the pipeline processes and processed dataset schema will be shared for transparency and reproducibility.

This comprehensive data pipeline will ensure a seamless and robust process, from raw data ingestion all the way through to providing a clean and transformed dataset ready for data-driven decision-making in house price prediction models.
