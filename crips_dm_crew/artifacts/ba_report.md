## Business Objective
- The objective is to predict house prices, which will help stakeholders make informed decisions about buying, selling, or investing in real estate.
- The type of problem is a regression problem, as the goal is to predict a continuous numeric value, i.e., the price of the house.

## Data Assessment
- **Summary of dataset:** The dataset comprises various features related to houses, like location, size, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, age, and other property-related characteristics. Each row likely represents a house, and the columns represent its attributes.
- **Target Variable:** The target variable is 'Price,' which indicates the price of each house in the dataset.
- **Features:** Typical features may include location, number of rooms, size in square footage, property age, etc.
- **Time Horizon:** If the dataset does not specify a time dimension, it implies static modeling. Ensure any temporal component is addressed if forecasting trends over time is necessary.

- **Mapping of dataset variables to the business objective:** 
  - 'Price' maps directly as the target variable.
  - Other variables providing dimensions like size, location, and age map as predictors, helping to understand what factors affect house prices.

## Suitability Check
- **Strengths:**
  - The dataset can answer questions related to how different features impact house prices.
  - Enables the development of predictive models that stakeholders can use to estimate future prices or assess current market value.

- **Limitations:**
  - If the dataset lacks temporal data, it cannot forecast future trends or account for seasonal variations.
  - Absence of economic or external influencing factors like interest rates, economic indicators, or neighborhood development information could limit the model's predictive power and generalizability.

- **Risks and assumptions:**
  - Assuming feature completeness and accuracy can lead to erroneous predictions.
  - Market volatility and unforeseen future economic conditions may not be reflected in historical data, impacting model reliability.

## Recommendation
- **Suggested next steps for data analysis and modeling:**
  1. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between variables and identify missing or anomalous data.
  2. Check for multicollinearity and potentially redundant features to ensure a robust predictive model.
  3. If missing data exists, apply appropriate imputation techniques.
  4. Consider acquiring supplementary data related to economic or demographic indicators to enhance model performance.
  5. Develop regression models using methods like linear regression, decision trees, or more sophisticated techniques, ensuring thorough cross-validation.
  6. If time-based forecasting is required, obtain time-sequenced data and incorporate it using models designed for time-series prediction.
  7. Regularly update the model with new data to improve accuracy and adapt to market changes.
