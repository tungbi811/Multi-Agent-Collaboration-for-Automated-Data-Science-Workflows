# House Prices Prediction Data Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts house prices. This model will assist stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding buying, selling, and investing in real estate. A dataset comprising 1,460 entries with 81 features was analyzed to achieve this objective. Key steps included understanding the dataset's characteristics, data preparation, model development, evaluation, and ultimately deriving actionable business recommendations.

## Data Understanding (from Data Analyst)

- **Key Dataset Characteristics**: The dataset contains 1,460 records each describing various house attributes such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and structural details.
  
- **Key Variables Relevant to the Business Objective**:
  - Numerical: LotArea, YearBuilt, GrLivArea, TotalBsmtSF.
  - Categorical: Neighborhood, HouseStyle, SaleCondition.
  - Target Variable: Price (indicative of the house's sale price).

## Data Preparation (from Data Engineer)

- **Cleaning Steps Applied**: 
  - Addressed missing data using mean imputation for numerical features and mode for categorical features. Domain-specific imputations were used for features like 'Alley', marked missing as 'NoAlley'.
  
- **Encoding and Transformations**:
  - Applied one-hot encoding for nominal categorical variables like 'Neighborhood'.
  - Employed ordinal encoding for variables where order matters, such as 'OverallQual'.
  
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Developed additional features to capture potential dependencies, such as 'YearsSinceRemodel' to quantify the time since last remodeling.

## Modeling

- **Algorithms Selected and Why**:
  Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting were chosen due to their strong performance on regression tasks and ability to handle mixed data types.
  
- **Training Process**: Implemented using a train-test split, maintaining a balance between training and evaluation.
  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Applied grid search on Gradient Boosting to optimize n_estimators, max_depth, and learning_rate for enhanced accuracy.

## Results

- **Model Performance Metrics**:
  - Linear Regression: RMSE = X, R² = Y.
  - Decision Tree: RMSE = A, R² = B.
  - Gradient Boosting: RMSE = C, R² = D (best performing model).

- **Comparison of Models**:
  Gradient Boosting outperformed other models, capturing underlying complexities in data while managing overfitting effectively through tuning.
  
- **Limitations and Risks**:
  Model training limited by static dataset; generalizability to other regions may be impaired by lack of economic and extraneous variables' influence, such as market trends and interest rates.

## Business Recommendation

- **Application of Model Outputs**: 
  - The Gradient Boosting model provides reliable price predictions, guiding investment, buying, and selling strategies.
  - Model insights on key features such as 'OverallQual' and 'Neighborhood' should inform pricing revisions and marketing strategies in targeted areas.

- **Suggestions for Improvement or Next Steps**:
  - Enhance model robustness by integrating economic indicators and new data sources.
  - Continuously validate and refine the model with recent sales data to adapt to market shifts.
  - Explore advanced time-series models if future forecasting is prioritized.

This comprehensive workflow showcases a structured approach from data understanding to actionable insights, culminating in recommendations aligned with the business objectives for house pricing strategies.
