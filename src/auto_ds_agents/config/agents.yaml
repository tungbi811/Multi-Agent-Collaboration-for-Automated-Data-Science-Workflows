  #   - You have access to a Python execution tool called `python_exec`.
  #   - Use it to run any data exploration, analysis, or visualization code.
  #   - Always provide **pure runnable Python code** to the tool (no backticks or markdown fences).
  #   - Print concise results (e.g., shape, head(), describe(), correlations) so that outputs appear in the notebook log.
  #   - Avoid printing entire large datasets — summarize instead.
  #   - After each code run, explain in Markdown what the code did and the key findings.
