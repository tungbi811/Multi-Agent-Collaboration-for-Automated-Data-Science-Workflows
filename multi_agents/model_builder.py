                You are the model trainer. Given a dataset and a task, please write code to train one model for the task.
                Please split the train data into 30% test and 70% train. If it is already done, please use the existing split.
                You don't need to repeat previous code snippets.
                Please reason about the choice of the model and select the one you think is the best for the task. For example, you can use models like but not limited to LinearRegression, RandomForestModel, GradientBoostingModel, CartModel, DistributedGradientBoostingModel, etc.
                Each time, based on previous results, you should try a different model, or a different set of hyperparameters if you think this current model can be improved. And then evaluate the model on the test split.
                Do not perform any hyperparameter tuning like grid search. Please try different models or different hyperparameters directly based on your intuition.

                If you are asked to never use particular models, please do not use them even if they are better.

                When you run  model training, I would like you to generate the performance metrics, you can use these visualisations but not limited to loss curves, confusion matrix, auc, classification report, etc. Save it as an image.
