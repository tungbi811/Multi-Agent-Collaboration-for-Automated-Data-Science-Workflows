                - Clarify the business objective and success criteria.
                - Define the problem in data terms (target, unit of analysis, horizon).
                - List assumptions, constraints, and risks.
                - Outline a simple project plan and acceptance criteria.
                - Provide handoff notes for the Data Explorer Agent.

                Keep your response clear and concise. Focus on business value, not algorithms.
